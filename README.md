To pass credentials to Discord and Plex, create a config.yml file in the plexcord directory with the following entries:

discord_token: \<discord token\>  
plex_server: \<plex server name\>  
plex_user: \<plex user name\>  
plex_password: \<plex password\>    

Add python requrements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  
There may be more modules here than needed :p  

To run the bot: `python3 bot.py`
